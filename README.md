# Java Project with Maven

Welcome to the JavaDevTask repository! This Maven-based Java project contains several utility classes designed to perform various tasks, from string manipulation to Excel file reading.

## Overview

The project includes the following classes:

1. **StringReversing**: Reverses a given string without using the integrated Java method `reverse()`.
2. **WordCounter**: Counts the number of words in a given text.
